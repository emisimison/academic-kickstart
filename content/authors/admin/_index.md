Hi! I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at MIT, with focus on Political Economy and Methodology. My recent work focuses on authoritarian regimes and how their institutions shape the extent to which citizens and interest groups influence policy making. For my dissertation, I am exploring the mechanisms through which changes in regime type affect policy to better understand how, and under which conditions, policy change takes place as a consequence of regime changes. 
I received a MA in Political Science from Torcuato Di Tella University (UTDT) and a BA from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA). Prior to MIT, I was a Ph.D. fellow at CONICET working at Gino Germani Research Institute, and taught at UBA and UTDT.
