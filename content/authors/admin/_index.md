Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Inter-American Policy and Research (CIPR) at Tulane University. My research focuses on the comparative political economy of policymaking and policy change. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, I  analyze how political institutions across regime types shape the extent to which citizens and interest groups influence policymaking, and how that affects policy outputs. As part of this research agenda, my book project (based on my PhD {{% staticref "files/Simison_Dissertation.pdf" "newtab" %}} dissertation{{% /staticref %}}) explores the relationship between regime types and public policies to better understand how, and under which conditions, policy change takes place as a consequence of regime type transitions.

I hold a PhD in Political Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I specialized in Comparative Political Economy and Methodology. I also received an MA from Torcuato Di Tella University (UTDT) and a BA from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), both in Political Science. Prior to MIT, I was a PhD fellow at CONICET working at Gino Germani Research Institute, and taught at UBA and UTDT.
