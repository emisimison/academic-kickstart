 abstract = {This article analyzes the responses of the government of Alberto Fernández of the Frente de Todos to the profound economic, social, and judicial challenges it faced in 2022. While the measures adopted to address the pressing economic situation and rising social conflict intensified existing disputes in the governing coalition, threatening its unity, the judicial processes and the government's response to them deepened polarization between the gov­ernment and the opposition, encouraging the internal unity of each coalition. The climate of polarization reached a peak with a failed assassination attempt against the vice president. Although these challenges and the internal disputes in the Frente de Todos severely weak­ened the president, the incumbent coalition remained stable and the ruling party remains competitive in the uncertain 2023 elections.},
